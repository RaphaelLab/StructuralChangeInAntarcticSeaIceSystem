# Overview 
This repository contains the `R` source code to reproduce analyses in the paper:

"[A Twenty-First Century Structural Change in Antarcticaâ€™s Sea ice
System](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02107-5)"

by Marilyn N. Raphael, Thomas J. Maierhofer, Ryan L. Fogt, William R. Hobbs, and Mark S. Handcock. It appears in *Nature-Communications Earth & Environment*, 2025.

This repository is live and will be maintained to ensure the code runs correctly. A static version of this code that coincides with the publication of the paper is available at [a zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14741173).

* At the top level are separate files of `R` code.
   * `Nature-s43247-025-02107-5-Plots.R`: Running this `R` code will reconstruct the plots in the paper and save them to the folder `Figures`. This takes about two minutes to run.
   * `Nature-s43247-025-02107-5-Events.R`: Running this `R` code will recompute the probabilities of the events analyzed in Section 3 of the paper and also create Supplementary Figure 3. This takes about 250 seconds to run.
   * `Nature-s43247-025-02107-5-dynamic-ARIMA.R`: Running this `R` code will fit the dynamic auto-regressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) analyzed in Section 4 of the paper. It will also produce various Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics, save the cores results and save plots of them to the folder `Figures`. The example takes about 250 seconds to run, but the one run in the paper uses all 2500 ensemble members and takes a day to run. There is a setting in the file that takes about a day to run and produces the results in the paper. The amount of computing is excessive, but the overall computational cost is minor.
   * `Nature-s43247-025-02107-5-dynamic-ARIMA-analysis.R`: Running this `R` code will summarize the results of the dynamic auto-regressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) analyzed in Section 4 of the paper (and the file `Nature-s43247-025-02107-5-dynamic-ARIMA-analysis.R`). It will also produce various diagnostics and save plots of them to the folder `Figures`.
