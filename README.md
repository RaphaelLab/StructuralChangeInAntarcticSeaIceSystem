#Overview 
This repository contains the `R` code and data to reproduce analyses in the paper:

"A Twenty-First Century Structural Change in Antarcticaâ€™s Sea ice System"

by Marilyn N. Raphael, Thomas J. Maierhofer, Ryan L. Fogt, William R. Hobbs, and Mark S. Handcock

# Requirements
The code is all in the `R` language for statistical computation. To run it you will need `R` installed on your
local machine as well as some standard `R` packages from `CRAN`. For an introduction to `R`, see [here](https://www.r-project.org/). 

# Installation
To explore the code, the easy way to clone the repository on your local machine and run the `R` code locally on your machine.
So first, [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

# What is in the repository?
The repository is comprised of four components: At the top level are  separate files of `R` code.

* **Data** This folder contains the two data files.
   * `nsidcV4.RData`: A version of the recorded sea ice extents from the National Snow and Ice Daat Center (NSIDC).
   * `reconstructions_regional.RDS`: An ensemble of reconstructions of the monthly sea ice extent. There are 2500 in number. The reconstruction file is large (110Mb).
* **Figures**: When the code is run the figures are saved in this folder as PDF and PNG files.
* **ExampleOutput**: This folder contains example outputs resulting from code runs. They are here to validate your runs.
* **R**:  At the top level are separate files of `R` code.
   * `Nature-2023-07-12845A-Plots.R`: Running this `R` code will reconstruct the plots in the paper and save them to the folder `Figures`. This
   * takes about 13 seconds to run.
   * `Nature-2023-07-12845A-Events.R`: Running this `R` code will recompute the probabilities of the events analyzed in Section 3 of the paper and also create Supplementary Figure 3. This takes about 250 seconds to run.
   * `Nature-2023-07-12845A-dynamic-ARIMA.R`: Running this `R` code will fit the dynamic auto-regressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) analyzed in Section 4 of the paper. It will also produce various Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics and save plots of them to the folder `Figures`. This takes about 64 seconds to run. There is a setting in the file that takes about 2 hours to run and produces the results in the paper. The amount of computing was excessive, but the computational cost is minor.
